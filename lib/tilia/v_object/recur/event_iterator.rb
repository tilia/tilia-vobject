      # This class is used to determine new for a recurring event, when the next
      # events occur.
      #
      # This iterator may loop infinitely in the future, therefore it is important
      # that if you use this class, you set hard limits for the amount of iterations
      # you want to handle.
      #
      # Note that currently there is not full support for the entire iCalendar
      # specification, as it's very complex and contains a lot of permutations
      # that's not yet used very often in software.
      #
      # For the focus has been on features as they actually appear in Calendaring
      # software, but this may well get expanded as needed / on demand
      #
      # The following RRULE properties are supported
      #   * UNTIL
      #   * INTERVAL
      #   * COUNT
      #   * FREQ=DAILY
      #     * BYDAY
      #     * BYHOUR
      #     * BYMONTH
      #   * FREQ=WEEKLY
      #     * BYDAY
      #     * BYHOUR
      #     * WKST
      #   * FREQ=MONTHLY
      #     * BYMONTHDAY
      #     * BYDAY
      #     * BYSETPOS
      #   * FREQ=YEARLY
      #     * BYMONTH
